# three-js-learning-utils
Following a three.js course, I realized there was some reusable utils that I could implement to keep learning and debugging my code

I started following this guy's threejs tutorial
https://sbcode.net/threejs/import-threejs-modules/

But he kept throwing away everything and restarting the repo, so as I followed along I made a mini-library that lets me go back and try whatever concept I built before.

Mostly justly to understand the components of what he's doing and have an abstraction layer over them
